<h1 lang="en" class="section">About me</h1>

<p lang="en">I don't like over-specialization, and I believe it should be avoided as much as possible. I do believe that in the course of one's life, specialization will come "naturally" alongside the experience acquired. But knowing upfront where you want to end up your life is a miserably way of living.</p>

<p lang="en">I currently work at Vox Populi as a Development Manager and studied statistics at <abbr title="Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais">UFMG</abbr>. I also help organize the meetup for data visualization practitioners and <a target="_blank" href="http://d3js.org">d3.js</a> users in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meetup.com/d3js-BH/">Belo Horizonte</a>, Brazil.</p>

<h1 lang="en" class="section">About this site</h1>

<p lang="en">I generated this site using Jekyll, host it at GitHub and the layout was inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.io">http://tom.preston-werner.com/</a>.</p>
